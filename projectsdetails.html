    <p style="border: 2px solid #91C8E4; width: 100%; background-color: #F6F4EB; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #749BC2;">The advancement of technology and sophistication in the field of automation and robotics
        has revolutionized every field of life. Machines that offer greater efficiency combined with
        the precision of the robotic systems are minimizing human involvement in dangerous areas
        and eliminating the limitations that bind the human body and brain. The human hand is a
        beautiful product of years of evolution with several movable joints and muscles. However,
        it is limited by its fragility to harsh, dangerous environment and its ability to bear weight.
        Numerical control (NC) is the automation of machine tools that are operated by precisely
        programmed commands encoded on a storage medium, as opposed to controlled manually
        via hand wheels or levers, or mechanically automated via cams alone. In modern CNC
        systems, end-to-end component design is highly automated using computer-aided design
        (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) programs. This project aims at
        designing and implementing a CNC machine for the purpose of welding. This machine can
        be used by a range of end users from large industries to small industries and even by
        hobbyist or for household purposes subject to its dimensions. This project is mainly
        concerned with addressing to reduce the time taken to make a weld with increased output
        and repeatability using NC Codes and an attempt to make the process accurate and
        automated.</p>

    <p style="border: 2px solid #91C8E4; width: 100%; background-color: #F6F4EB; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #749BC2;"> An obstacle avoiding robot is a fully autonomous robot which can be able to avoid any obstacle which it face when it move. Simply, when it met an obstacle while it moving forward, automatically stop moving forward and makes a step back. Then it looks it's two sides left & right and starts to move the best possible way; which means either in left direction if there is another obstacle in right or in right direction if there is another obstacle in left side. The obstacle avoiding robot is very helpful and it is the base of many large projects such as Automatic cars, robots used in Manufacturing factories, even in robots used in spacecrafts.</p>
